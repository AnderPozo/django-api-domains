# Pin against a version

In software we often specify a version of a project to use.

For example - `requests==1.2` - this says _"use requests version 1.2"_.

For this guide, we recommend the following picking a specific version and working against it. Just like software; future versions of this guide could change and that would mean conflicting issues with the styleguide in your projects.

You can see the released versions [here](https://github.com/phalt/django-api-domains/releases) and by clicking on the tag icon you can view historical versions. The published version at [https://phalt.github.io/django-api-domains](https://phalt.github.io/django-api-domains) will always be the latest version.

# Be pragmatic

Don't blindly follow what other people have written down. Sometimes it might not be suitable for your own problem. Use this guide as inspiration and guidance, but make your own decisions with your team when you aren't satisfied with it.

Just make sure you keep track of any additional rules you create.
