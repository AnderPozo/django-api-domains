The abstraction between books and authors is only present to demonstrate the concepts in the styleguide. You could argue that Books and Authors can live in one domain. In our example we also assume a book can only have one author. It's a strange world. Models Models defines how a data model/ database table looks. This is a Django convention that remains mostly unchanged. The key difference here is that you use skinny models . No complex functional logic should live here. In the past Django has recommended an active record style for it's models. In practice, we have found that this encourages developers to make models.py bloated and do too much - often binding the presentation and functional logic of a domain too tightly. This makes it very hard to have abstract presentations of the data in a domain. Putting all the logic in one place also makes it difficult to scale the number of developers working in this part of the codebase. See the \"Which logic lives where?\" section for clarification. A models.py file can look like: import uuid from django.db import models class Book(models.Model): id = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid.uuid4) name = models.CharField(max_length=256) publisher = models.CharField(max_length=256) author_id = models.UUIDField(default=uuid.uuid4) @property def name_and_publisher(self): return f'{self.name}, {self.publisher}' Models must not have any complex functional logic in them. Models should own informational logic related to them. Models can have computed properties where it makes sense. Models must not import services, interfaces, or apis from their own domain or other domains. Table dependencies (such as ForeignKeys) must not exist across domains. Use a UUID field instead, and have your Services control the relationship between models. You can use ForeignKeys between tables in one domain. (But be aware that this might hinder future refactoring.) APIs APIs defines the external API interface for your domain. Anyone using the APIs defined here is called a consumer . The API can be either an HTTP API using GraphQL or REST for consumers over the web, or a software API for internal consumers. APIs is defined in apis.py which is agnostic to the implementation you choose, and you can even put more than one API in a domain. For example - you might want to wrap a GraphQL API and a REST API around your domain for different consumers. An apis.py file that defines a simple software API can look like: import logging import uuid from typing import Dict # noqa from .services import BookService logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) class BookAPI: @staticmethod def get(*, book_id: uuid.UUID) -> Dict: logger.info('method \"get\" called') return BookService.get_book(id=book_id) APIs must be used as the entry point for all other consumers who wish to use this domain. APIs should own presentational logic and schema declarations. Internal domain-to-domain APIs should just be functions. You can group internal API functions under a class if it makes sense for organisation. If you are using a class for your internal APIs, it must use the naming convention MyDomainAPI . Internal functions in APIs must use type annotations. Internal functions in APIs must use keyword arguments. You should log API function calls. All data returned from APIs must be serializable. APIs must talk to Services to get data. APIs must not talk to Models directly. APIs should do simple logic like transforming data for the outside world, or taking external data and transforming it for the domain to understand. Objects represented through APIs do not have to map directly to internal database representations of data. Interfaces Your domain may need to communicate with another domain. That domain can be in another web server across the web, or it could be within the same server. It could even be a third-party service. When your domain needs to talk to other domains, you should define all interactions with it in the interfaces.py file . Combined with APIs (see above), this forms the bounded context of the domain, and prevents domain logic leaking in. Consider interfaces.py like a mini Anti-Corruption Layer . Most of the time it won't change and it'll just pass on arguments to an API function. But when the other domain moves - say you extract it into it's own web service, your domain only needs to update the code in interfaces.py to reflect the change. No complex refactoring needed, woohoo! It's worth noting that some guides would consider this implementation a code smell because it has the potential for creating shallow methods or pass-through methods. This is somewhat true, and leads us back to the pragmatism point in our guide. If you find your interfaces.py is redundant, then you probably don't need it. That said: we recommend starting with it and removing it later . An interfaces.py may look like: import uuid from typing import Dict, Str # noqa # Could be an internal domain or an HTTP API client - we don't care! from src.authors.apis import AuthorAPI # plain example def update_author_name(*, author_name: Str, author_id: uuid.UUID) -> None: AuthorAPI.update_author_name( id=author_id, name=author_name, ) # class example class AuthorInterface: @staticmethod def get_author(*, id: uuid.UUID) -> Dict: return AuthorAPI.get(id=id) @staticmethod def update_author_name( *, author_name: Str, author_id: uuid.UUID, ) -> None: AuthorAPI.update_author_name( id=author_id, name=author_name, ) The primary components of Interfaces should be functions. You can group functions under a class if it makes sense for organisation. If you are using a class, it must use the naming convention MyDomainInterface . Functions in Interfaces must use type annotations. Functions in Interfaces must use keyword arguments. Services Everything in a domain comes together in Services. Services gather all the business value for this domain. What type of logic should live here? Here are a few examples: When creating a new instance of a model, we need to compute a field on it before saving. When querying some content, we need to collect it from a few different places and gather it together in a python object. When deleting an instance we need to send a signal to another domain so it can do it's own logic. Anything that is specific to the domain problem and not basic informational logic should live in Services. As most API projects expose single functional actions such as Create, Read, Update, and Delete, Services has been designed specifically to compliment stateless, single-action functions. A services.py file could look like: import logging import uuid from typing import Dict, Str # noqa from .interfaces import AuthorInterface from .models import Book logger = logging.getLogger(__name__) # Plain example def get_book(*, id: uuid.UUID) -> Book: book = Book.objects.get(id=id) author = AuthorInterface.get_author(id=book.author_id) return { 'name': book.name, 'author_name': author.name, } # Class example class PGMNodeService: @staticmethod def get_book(*, id: uuid.UUID) -> Dict: book = Book.objects.get(id=id) author = AuthorInterface.get_author(id=book.author_id) return { 'name': book.name, 'author_name': author.name, } @staticmethod def create_book(*, name: Str, author_id: uuid.UUID) -> Dict: logger.info('Creating new book') new_book = Book.objects.create(name=name, author_id=author_id) author = AuthorInterface.get_author(id=new_book.author_id) return { 'name': new_book.name, 'author_name': author.name, } @staticmethod def update_book_name_and_author_name( *, name: Str, author_name: Str, author_id: uuid.UUID, id: uuid.UUID, ) -> Dict: logger.info('Updating book name and author name') book = Book.objects.get(id=id).update(name=name) author = AuthorInterface.update_author_name( name=author_name, id=author_id, ) return { 'name': book.name, 'author_name': author.name, } The primary components of Services should be functions.

In addition, any existing files from a standard Django app are still allowed, such as urls.py , apps.py and migrations/* . Views.py in Django's pattern is explicitly not allowed in this styleguide. We only focus on API-based applications. Most logic that used to live in Django's views.py would now be separated into APIs and Services. You can mask one of the required files as a directory for better file organisation. For example, you might want to split apis.py file into this structure: apis/ __init__.py rest.py graphql.py Your __init__.py file in this directory can import the local files: # apis/__init__.py from .rest import * # noqa from .graphql import * # noqa Then, any other file can then import from apis like so: # example.py from domain.apis import Foo This keeps namespaces tidy and does not leak domain details. A domain does not need to have all these files if it is not using them. For example - a domain that just coordinates API calls to other domains does not need to have Models as it is probably not storing anything in a datastore. A domain can have additional files when it makes sense (such as utils.py or enums.py or serializers.py ) to separate out parts of the code that aren't covered by the styleguide pattern. Read more about the files in the files section. Absolute or Relative imports? The ruling for absolute or relative imports is as follows: When importing files within a domain, you must use relative imports. When importing other domains in the same project, you must use absolute imports. When importing domains in tests, you should use absolute imports. When importing third-party packages you should use absolute imports. TL;DR - relative imports inside a domain, absolute for everything else! With this ruling domains are easy to package and move around. When it comes time to move it into it's own project; tidying up imports will be one less thing you have to do. Which logic lives where? It's common in programming to end up confused about what type of logic should live where. There are many cases where it's difficult to decide, and the best advice is to pick a pattern and stick to it , but for simpler things, this guide emphasises the following: APIs Logic about presentation. If you ask: \"Where should I show this data to the user?\" or \"Where do I define the API schema?\" Services Logic around coordination and transactions. If you ask: \"Where do I coordinate updating many models in one domain?\" or \"Where do I dispatch a single action out to other domains?\" Models Logic around information. If you ask: \"Where can I store this data?\" or \"Where can I do any post/pre-save actions?\" Interfaces Logic handling the transformation of data from other domains.

When importing third-party packages you should use absolute imports. TL;DR - relative imports inside a domain, absolute for everything else! With this ruling domains are easy to package and move around. When it comes time to move it into it's own project; tidying up imports will be one less thing you have to do.","title":"Absolute or Relative imports?"},{"location":"styleguide/#which-logic-lives-where","text":"It's common in programming to end up confused about what type of logic should live where.
